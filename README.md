# Steganography
Stego.c and StegoExtract.c are the two main files in this project. Stego.c is used to embed a message in the given pgm image
and StegoExtract.c is used to extract the payload from the a stego image generated by the stego program.

There are three parts to embedding data within the cover image.
1.  The first 32-bytes of the cover image is used to embed the 32-bits of b.size (the size field for the binary data file -- 
payload).

2.  The second 32-bytes of the cover image is used to embed the 8 digits of G# (ID) in numerical form (using 4-bits per digit).

3.  After this, each byte of data will be embedded into the LSBs of the cover image.

StegoExtract.c reverses the steps followed in Stego.c

Project guided by Prof. Zorian Duric, George Mason University.
