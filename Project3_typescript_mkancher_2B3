did u know that a long time ago there once was a young hot wing he was a very nice hot wing except he wanted to he tomato's not just normal tamato's but tomato's from a clowns nose. he had to have the clowns nose's for every meal but they had to be used.this hot wing ended up as a model in the 1780's. he turned out nice and red with hot sauce. one day at a modeling show a guy decided to go up on stage and take a big juicy bite out of the hot wing. the hot wing cried and cried for a million years because he could no longer be a model. after he cried forever he was very moldy so he started to cry again. after that the little moldy parts came of of him and became SERGEANTS they stictiched up the hotwings whole. by now the young hot wing is a very old BUT HE STILL COMPLETED HIS MODELING CAREER. after the SERGEANT'S fixed up the hot wing they got a hotdog and ate it.

TO BE OR NOT TO BE

"To be or not to be? That is the questionâ€”
Whether â€™tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And, by opposing, end them? To die, to sleepâ€”
No moreâ€”and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir toâ€”â€™tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished! To die, to sleep.
To sleep, perchance to dreamâ€”ay, thereâ€™s the rub,
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. Thereâ€™s the respect
That makes calamity of so long life."

				 William Shakespeare
